/*
    Each call to Typeface.createFromAsset will load a new instance of the typeface into memory,
    and this memory is not consistently get garbage collected
    http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9904
    (It states released but even on Lollipop you can see the typefaces accumulate even after
    multiple GC passes)

    You can detect this by running:
    adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.your.packagenage

    You will see output like:

     Asset Allocations
